# React Authentication Project

This is a simple React authentication project that allows users to log in as either an admin or a regular user, and displays different content based on their role. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for a smoother user experience, enabling users to stay authenticated without having to re-enter their credentials for each request. The user's token and role are stored in local storage.

## Features

- User authentication as admin or user.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based content display.
